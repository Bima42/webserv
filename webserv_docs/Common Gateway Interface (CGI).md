# Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
---
- interface between web server and programs we write
- lets those programs process HTML forms or other data coming from client and lets CGI send a response back to the client (like HTML docs, GIF, video...)
- makes our web pages more interactive with user
- _gateway_ is used to describe connection between program and HTTP web server
